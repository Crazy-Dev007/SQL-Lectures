SQL Constraint (Primary Key) Explained with Examples and WH Questions:

1. What is a Primary Key Constraint?
A primary key constraint in SQL is a rule applied to a column or a set of columns within a table. It ensures that the values in the specified column(s) are unique and not null, which means each row in the table can be uniquely identified using the primary key values.

2. Why do we use Primary Key Constraints?
Primary key constraints are used to uniquely identify records in a table and maintain data integrity. They ensure that no two rows have the same values in the primary key column(s), and they also prevent the storage of null values in these columns.

3. When is a Primary Key Constraint Used?
A primary key constraint is used when you need to enforce uniqueness and identification for rows in a table. It's commonly applied to columns that hold values like unique IDs, account numbers, or any other piece of data that can be used to uniquely distinguish one record from another.

4. Where is a Primary Key Constraint Applied?
The primary key constraint is applied to one or more columns within a table. Typically, it's chosen from existing columns that contain unique values. If no suitable column exists, a new column can be added specifically for this purpose.

5. How to Define a Primary Key Constraint?
A primary key constraint can be defined during table creation or added to an existing table using the PRIMARY KEY keyword.

6. Example: Defining a Primary Key Constraint during Table Creation

Let's consider a simple example using a table named Students:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);


In this example, the student_id column is designated as the primary key. It must hold unique values for each row, and it cannot contain null values.

7. Example: Adding a Primary Key Constraint to an Existing Table

Suppose we have an existing table named Employees, and we want to add a primary key constraint:

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD PRIMARY KEY (employee_id);


Here, the employee_id column is chosen as the primary key.

8. WH Questions Summary:

What: A primary key constraint ensures unique and non-null values in specified columns.
Why: To uniquely identify records and maintain data integrity.
When: When you need to uniquely identify rows in a table.
Where: It's applied to one or more columns within a table.
How: It can be defined during table creation or added later using the PRIMARY KEY keyword.
Example: In the Students table, the student_id column is the primary key.

In summary, a primary key constraint is a fundamental concept in relational databases, ensuring data uniqueness and integrity while enabling efficient data retrieval and management.
