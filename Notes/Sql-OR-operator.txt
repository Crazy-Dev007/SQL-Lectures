SQL LOGIC operator( OR  ) Explain With Wh Questions ?

In SQL, the OR operator is a logical operator used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause to retrieve rows that satisfy at least one of the specified conditions. It allows you to create more complex queries by broadening the scope of your search. The OR operator returns true if any of the conditions it connects are true.

Let's break down the OR operator using the "Wh-questions" (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How) to explain it in detail:

1. Who uses the OR operator?
SQL developers and database administrators use the OR operator when writing queries to retrieve data from a database based on multiple conditions.

2. What does the OR operator do?
The OR operator combines two or more conditions in a WHERE clause to select rows that meet either one of those conditions.

3. Where is the OR operator used?
The OR operator is used within the WHERE clause of a SQL query.

4. When is the OR operator used?
The OR operator is used when you want to retrieve data that matches any of the specified conditions. It broadens the search criteria.

5. Why use the OR operator?
The OR operator is used to create more flexible queries. It allows you to retrieve data that satisfies at least one of the conditions, which can be useful when you're interested in a wider range of results.

6. How does the OR operator work?
The OR operator evaluates the conditions on both sides of it and returns true if at least one of the conditions is true. If none of the conditions are true, then the OR operator evaluates to false.

Now, let's illustrate with an example:

Suppose you have a database with a table named employees that contains information about employees, including their names, ages, and job titles. You want to retrieve employees who are either in the "Manager" role or are younger than 30. Here's how you would use the OR operator to accomplish this:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE job_title = 'Manager' OR age < 30;


In this example:

The OR operator combines two conditions: job_title = 'Manager' and age < 30.
The query retrieves all rows from the employees table where either of these conditions is true.
If an employee is a manager (regardless of their age) or if they are under 30 (regardless of their job title), they will be included in the result.

Remember that the OR operator doesn't require both conditions to be true. It only needs one of them to be true for a row to be included in the result set.
