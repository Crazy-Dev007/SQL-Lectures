What is Data Query Language (DQL)?
Data Query Language (DQL) is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in a database. 
It focuses on querying the database to extract specific information based on user-defined criteria.

Why is Data Query Language (DQL) important?
DQL is important because it allows users to interact with databases by retrieving only the data they need. 
This helps in making informed decisions, analyzing trends, and gaining insights from the stored information.

Who uses Data Query Language (DQL)?
DQL is used by database administrators, data analysts, software developers, and anyone who needs to extract and analyze data from a database.

When is Data Query Language (DQL) used?
DQL is used whenever there's a need to retrieve specific data from a database. 
This could be for generating reports, conducting analyses, displaying information in applications, or making data-driven decisions.

Where is Data Query Language (DQL) used?
DQL is used within database management systems (DBMS) or relational database systems. 
It's embedded in applications, websites, and software that need to interact with databases to retrieve and manipulate data.

How does Data Query Language (DQL) work?
DQL works by using specific query statements written in SQL to communicate with a database. 
These query statements define what data to retrieve, how to filter it, and how to arrange and present the results. 
The database management system then processes these queries and returns the requested data.

In summary, Data Query Language (DQL) is a crucial component of database management. 
It enables users to retrieve specific information from databases using structured query statements, aiding in data analysis, decision-making, and application development.
