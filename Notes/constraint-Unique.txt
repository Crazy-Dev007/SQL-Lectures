Sure, I'd be happy to explain SQL constraints, specifically the UNIQUE constraint, using the "Wh-Questions" (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How). Let's dive in:

What is the UNIQUE Constraint?
The UNIQUE constraint in SQL is used to ensure that values in a column or a group of columns are unique across all the rows in a table. It ensures that no two rows have the same values in the specified columns, preventing duplicate entries.

Why is the UNIQUE Constraint Used?
The UNIQUE constraint is used to maintain data integrity and avoid duplication in a database table. It's particularly helpful when you want to enforce uniqueness on columns that should contain only distinct values, such as email addresses, usernames, identification numbers, etc.

Where is the UNIQUE Constraint Applied?
The UNIQUE constraint is applied at the column level. It can be applied to a single column or a combination of columns.

When is the UNIQUE Constraint Enforced?
The UNIQUE constraint is enforced when data is inserted or updated in the table. The database system checks if the values being inserted or updated in the specified column(s) already exist in the table. If a duplicate value is found, the system raises an error, and the operation is rejected.

How is the UNIQUE Constraint Implemented?
When you create a table, you can add the UNIQUE constraint to one or more columns using the UNIQUE keyword. Here's an example of how to create a table with a UNIQUE constraint:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    -- Other columns
);


In this example, both the username and email columns have the UNIQUE constraint. This means that no two rows can have the same username or email.

Example Scenario:
Let's consider a table named employees where you want to ensure that each employee's Social Security Number (SSN) is unique. You can use the UNIQUE constraint to achieve this:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    ssn VARCHAR(9) UNIQUE,
    -- Other columns
);


In this scenario, the ssn column has a UNIQUE constraint, ensuring that no two employees can have the same Social Security Number.

Summary:
The UNIQUE constraint in SQL ensures that values in a specified column or columns are unique across all rows in a table. It's used to prevent duplicate entries, maintain data integrity, and enforce uniqueness on certain attributes. This constraint is applied at the column level and is enforced during data insertion and updating. It helps to eliminate data redundancy and improve the overall quality of the database.
