SQL ( REVOKE) Explain With Wh Questions ?  by Microsoft T-SQL
------------------
ChatGPT:


Certainly! Let's break down the SQL REVOKE statement using the "Wh" questions: What, Why, When, Where, Who, and How. We'll focus on Microsoft T-SQL.

What is the REVOKE statement?
The REVOKE statement is used in SQL (Structured Query Language) to remove specific permissions or privileges that have been granted previously on database objects, such as tables, views, procedures, or functions.

Why use the REVOKE statement?
The REVOKE statement is used to restrict or revoke previously granted permissions from users or roles. This can be necessary when you want to limit access to certain parts of the database or ensure security by reducing unnecessary privileges.

When would you use the REVOKE statement?
You would use the REVOKE statement when you need to change or remove permissions from users or roles. This could be due to changes in roles or responsibilities, security updates, or changes in data access requirements.

Where can the REVOKE statement be applied?
The REVOKE statement is applied within a database environment. You can use it on specific objects like tables, views, stored procedures, etc. It is executed using SQL management tools, SQL command-line interfaces, or within scripts.

Who can use the REVOKE statement?
Database administrators or users with sufficient privileges can use the REVOKE statement. It requires appropriate privileges to modify permissions on database objects.

How is the REVOKE statement used?
In T-SQL, the syntax of the REVOKE statement is as follows:

sql
Copy code
REVOKE [permissions] ON [object] FROM [principal];

[permissions] refers to the specific permissions you want to revoke, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE, etc.
[object] is the database object (e.g., table, view, procedure) from which you want to revoke the permissions.
[principal] is the user or role from whom you want to revoke the permissions.

For example, to revoke the SELECT permission on a table named Employee from a user named John, you would use:

sql
Copy code
REVOKE SELECT ON dbo.Employee FROM John;


Remember that revoking permissions can impact users' ability to interact with the database objects, so it's important to carefully consider the changes you're making.

In summary, the REVOKE statement in T-SQL is a powerful tool for managing permissions within a database environment, allowing you to restrict or remove access to specific database objects for users or roles.

SQL ( Revoke) Explain with Example ? In Detail ? 
------------------
ChatGPT:


Certainly! Let's go through a detailed example of using the REVOKE statement in SQL. In this example, we'll assume you're working with a Microsoft SQL Server database and want to revoke the SELECT privilege on a table named Orders from a user named SalesUser.

Step 1: Granting Initial Permission
Before we revoke a permission, let's assume that the SalesUser initially had the SELECT permission on the Orders table. Here's how you might have granted this permission:

sql
Copy code
GRANT SELECT ON dbo.Orders TO SalesUser;


This command grants the SELECT permission on the Orders table to the SalesUser.

Step 2: Verifying the Permission
You can use the following query to verify that the SalesUser has the SELECT permission on the Orders table:

sql
Copy code
USE YourDatabaseName;
SELECT HAS_PERMS_BY_NAME('dbo.Orders', 'OBJECT', 'SELECT') AS HasSelectPermission;


The query will return a result indicating whether the user has the SELECT permission (1 for true, 0 for false).

Step 3: Revoking the Permission
Now, let's say you want to revoke the SELECT permission from the SalesUser. You can use the following REVOKE statement:

sql
Copy code
REVOKE SELECT ON dbo.Orders FROM SalesUser;


This command revokes the SELECT permission on the Orders table from the SalesUser.

Step 4: Verifying the Revocation
You can again verify the permission using the same query as in Step 2:

sql
Copy code
USE YourDatabaseName;
SELECT HAS_PERMS_BY_NAME('dbo.Orders', 'OBJECT', 'SELECT') AS HasSelectPermission;


Now, the query will likely return 0, indicating that the SalesUser no longer has the SELECT permission on the Orders table.

Step 5: Confirming the Change
You can also query the system views to see the current permissions on the table. Run the following query to see the permissions on the Orders table:

sql
Copy code
USE YourDatabaseName;
SELECT
    p.name AS PrincipalName,
    pe.permission_name AS PermissionName,
    o.name AS ObjectName
FROM sys.database_permissions AS pe
INNER JOIN sys.database_principals AS p ON pe.grantee_principal_id = p.principal_id
INNER JOIN sys.objects AS o ON pe.major_id = o.object_id
WHERE o.name = 'Orders';


This query will display information about the permissions on the Orders table. After the REVOKE statement, you should not see the SalesUser with the SELECT permission in the results.

That's it! You've successfully used the REVOKE statement to remove a specific permission from a user on a table within a SQL Server database.
